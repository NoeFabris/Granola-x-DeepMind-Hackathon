# Official Granola MCP

**URL:** `https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp`

## What It Is
- Official MCP server hosted by Granola
- Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Code, and any MCP client
- OAuth authentication via Granola account
- Requires paid Granola plan

## Authentication Flow
1. User connects their Granola account
2. OAuth flow authenticates
3. MCP client can then access meeting notes

## Integration Options
1. **Native MCP Clients** (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) - Just add the URL
2. **Custom MCP Client** - Connect to `https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp`

## For Our Web App
Since we're building a web app (not an MCP client), we have two options:
1. **Build as MCP Client** - Implement MCP protocol in our backend
2. **Use MCP-to-HTTP bridge** - Create a service that acts as MCP client and exposes HTTP API

## Enterprise
- Available in early access beta for Enterprise plans
- Off by default, admins enable in Settings > Security
