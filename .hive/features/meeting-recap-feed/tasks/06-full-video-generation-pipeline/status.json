  "summary": "Implemented full end-to-end video generation orchestration in `src/lib/video-pipeline.ts` and added `src/app/api/generate-video/route.ts` with a single endpoint flow: `POST` runs meeting -> script -> clips -> stitch and returns final `videoUrl`, `GET ?runId=` returns progress for UI polling, and `GET ?videoId=` serves temporarily stored playback video bytes from in-memory TTL storage. Added RED->GREEN coverage in `tests/full-video-generation-pipeline.test.mjs` and appended Task 06 entries to learnings/decisions/issues notepads. Verification run: `node --test tests/full-video-generation-pipeline.test.mjs`, then `npm test && npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit` (all passing; installed missing dependencies with `npm install` in worktree before final verification).",
