  "summary": "Polished UI for mobile + dark mode: added new `Header` branding overlay, introduced safe-area + theme CSS variables and global utilities in `globals.css`, switched feed heights to `100dvh` and hid scrollbars for a more native snap experience, and refreshed all components with smoother animations/focus styles and dark-mode-friendly meeting list styling. Added a regression test for the new polish requirements. Verified with `npm test` (42/42), `npm run build`, and `npx tsc --noEmit`.",
