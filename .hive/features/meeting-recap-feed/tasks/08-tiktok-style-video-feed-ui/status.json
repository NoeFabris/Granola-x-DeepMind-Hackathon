Added TDD coverage in `tests/tiktok-style-video-feed-ui.test.mjs` (RED->GREEN) for required files, snap feed behavior, auto play/pause logic, controls scope, and homepage wiring. Appended Task 08 learnings/decisions/issues notepad entries. Verification completed with `npm test && npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit` (33/33 tests passing, Next.js build successful, typecheck clean).",
