  "GranolaTok" — 2 Min Demo Video Script

  [0:00–0:15] HOOK

  Visual: Someone scrolling TikTok in bed, laughing. Cut to them the next
  morning, glazed over staring at a wall of meeting notes.

  Voiceover:
  "You'll watch 47 TikToks before bed but won't read a single meeting summary.
  What if your meetings came to you the same way?"

  ---
  [0:15–0:35] THE PROBLEM

  Visual: Fast montage — calendar packed with meetings, Granola summaries
  stacking up unread, a founder rubbing their eyes.

  Voiceover:
  "Sam Altman says we'll see the first one-person billion-dollar company. That
  person is going to be in a LOT of meetings. And they're not going to have time
   — or the attention span — to read through pages of notes. The future CEO grew
   up on 60-second videos, not memos."

  [0:35–0:55] THE SOLUTION

  Visual: Phone notification — "Your meetings are ready to watch." App opens,
  TikTok-style vertical feed of meeting recaps.

  Voiceover:
  "Meet GranolaTok. It takes your Granola meeting transcripts and turns them
  into short, scroll-able video recaps — the same format your brain already
  craves. Powered by Gemini."

  [0:55–1:35] THE DEMO

  Visual: Screen recording of the actual product working.

  Show the flow:
  1. Granola transcript goes in — show a real meeting transcript
  2. Gemini extracts key moments — show the AI picking out decisions, action
  items, funny quotes
  3. Video gets generated — show it producing a TikTok-style clip with captions,
   background music, and visuals
  4. Swipe through your day — show a feed of 3-4 meeting recaps, swiping
  vertically like TikTok

  Voiceover:
  "After each meeting, Gemini reads your Granola transcript, pulls out what
  actually matters — decisions, action items, key moments — and generates a
  short video recap. At the end of the day, you just scroll. Each meeting, 30
  seconds or less."

  [1:35–1:55] WHY IT WORKS

  Visual: Split screen — left side: unread meeting notes piling up. Right side:
  someone casually swiping through recaps on the couch.

  Voiceover:
  "We don't have a productivity problem. We have a format problem. People
  consume hours of content daily — just not in documents. GranolaTok meets you
  where you already are."

  ---
  [1:55–2:00] CLOSE

  Visual: Logo + tagline on screen.

  Text on screen: "GranolaTok — your meetings, but watchable."
